5. Pagination

If a user has 100+ notes, listing them on one page is slow.

Use Djangoâ€™s Paginator class to split into pages.

6. File Uploads

Add an attachment field in notes (upload PDFs/images).

Learn about MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT.

7. AJAX / REST API

Make your search work live (without refreshing page) using AJAX.

Or build a REST API for notes using Django REST Framework (DRF).

8. Deployment Concepts

Set up proper STATICFILES_DIRS, whitenoise, gunicorn, etc.

Deploy your app to Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or Railway.

ðŸ”¹ When to build a new project?

Once youâ€™ve implemented most of the above in your note app, youâ€™ll have covered almost all core Django features.
Then you can start a new project to practice:

e-commerce (cart, checkout, payments)

blog (categories, tags, comments, likes)

social app (friends, messages, notifications)
